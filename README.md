Tomahawk, the critically acclaimed multi-source music player, is almost available on  iOS. Given the name of an artist, album or song Tomahawk will find the best available source and play it - whether that be from Spotify, Deezer, GMusic, Soundcloud, Tidal, Official.fm, Jamendo, Beets, Ampache, Subsonic or your phoneâ€™s local storage. Tomahawk for iOS also syncs your history, your loved tracks, artists, albums and your playlists to/from the desktop version of Tomahawk via our new music community, Hatchet. On Hatchet you can hear your friends' favorite tracks and see what they're currently listening to. This is a very much pre-alpha version. Stay tuned for more updates to come!
