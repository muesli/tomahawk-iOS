[Tomahawk for iOS](https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk-ios)

Exclusive just became a little less. Tomahawk is now (sort of) on iOS. This is a very much pre-alpha version. At the miunute it's just the UI I am working on but as soon as that is finished I will move on to actually adding some functionality.

If you are wondering what this is going to look like when it's finished head over to https://invis.io/UX3RGU3GT and check it out. Also PLEASE tell me what you think about the UI. It can only get better with your help.
